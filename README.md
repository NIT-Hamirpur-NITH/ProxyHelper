This repository will contain the code for a **cool** application that would remove the need to use FoxyProxy and likes.


Pings multiple proxies in parallel and sets the fastest one for you!!

### INCOMPLETE AS OF NOW, DON'T INSTALL

To install the script
```
1) Clone the directory
2) cd ProxyHelper
3) chmod +x install.sh
4) sudo ./install.sh
```

To reset the proxy ( Pass a **None** argument )
```
sudo ./zetproxy None
```

Mostly not required ( nor recommended )

##### To edit the proxy pool
```
1) Open surely_parallel.py in your favorite text editor
2) Look for the **proxies** list near the top
3) Add/Remove proxy from the list 
```
